My implementation of 2048, originally implemented by Gabriele Cirulli: http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/

You need to set VM options to

    -Djava.library.path=lib/natives-linux

or
    -Djava.library.path=lib/natives-windows

There are two runnable classes - Main and RenderTest. Main is main game and RenderTest shows all kinds of tiles on screen.

For creating production packages use JarSplice: http://ninjacave.com/jarsplice
